abstract = { Subword composition plays an important role in a lot of analyses of sequences. Here we define and study the "local decoding of order N of sequences," an alternative that avoids some drawbacks of "subwords of length N" approaches while keeping informations about environments of length N in the sequences ("decoding" is taken here in the sense of hidden Markov modeling, i.e., associating some state to all positions of the sequence). We present an algorithm for computing the local decoding of order N of a given set of sequences. Its complexity is linear in the total length of the set (whatever the order N) both in time and memory space. In order to show a use of local decoding, we propose a very basic dissimilarity measure between sequences which can be computed both from local decoding of order N and composition in subwords of length N. The accuracies of these two dissimilarities are evaluated, over several datasets, by computing their linear correlations with a reference alignment-based distance. These accuracies are also compared to the one obtained from another recent alignment-free comparison. }

	abstract = {Algorithms for constructing phylogenetic trees are fundamental to study the evolution of viruses, bacteria, and other microbes. Established multiple alignment-based algorithms are inefficient for large scale metagenomic sequence data because of their high requirement of inter-sequence correlation and high computational complexity. In this paper, we present SeqDistK, a novel tool for alignment-free phylogenetic analysis. SeqDistK computes the dissimilarity matrix for phylogenetic analysis, incorporating seven k-mer based dissimilarity measures, namely d2, d2S, d2star, Euclidean, Manhattan, CVTree, and Chebyshev. Based on these dissimilarities, SeqDistK constructs phylogenetic tree using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean algorithm. Using a golden standard dataset of 16S rRNA and its associated phylogenetic tree, we compared SeqDistK to Muscle {\textendash} a multi sequence aligner. We found SeqDistK was not only 38 times faster than Muscle in computational efficiency but also more accurate. SeqDistK achieved the smallest symmetric difference between the inferred and ground truth trees with a range between 13 to 18, while that of Muscle was 62. When measures d2, d2star, d2S, Euclidean, and k-mer size k=5 were used, SeqDistK consistently inferred phylogenetic tree almost identical to the ground truth tree. We also performed clustering of 16S rRNA sequences using SeqDistK and found the clustering was highly consistent with known biological taxonomy. Among all the measures, d2S (k=5, M=2) showed the best accuracy as it correctly clustered and classified all sample sequences. In summary, SeqDistK is a novel, fast and accurate alignment-free tool for large-scale phylogenetic analysis.
